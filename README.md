Brief  write-up about the skills I gained during the Bootcamp

During the months taking the Full Stack Developer Course, I've come to learn Javascript, ReactJS, and NodeJS and how these work on websites with HTML & CSS.
Most of all, I've learnt to work with my colleagues, coming together to solve code problems and learning from each other's mistakes.
